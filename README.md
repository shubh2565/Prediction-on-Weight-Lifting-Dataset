# Prediction-on-Weight-Lifting-Dataset

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

This project is the part of peer-graded assignment for the course: [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) offered on _Coursera_.
