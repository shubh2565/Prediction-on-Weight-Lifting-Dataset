## Introduction
**Human Activity Recognition** - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing attention by the pervasive computing research community (see picture below, that illustrates the increasing number of publications in HAR with wearable accelerometers), especially for the development of context-aware systems. There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises.

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: [_Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset._](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)

The training data for this project are available here: [_Training Data_](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)

The test data are available here: [_Test Data_](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

### Loading R libraries and Data
We first load the R libraries that are necessary for the complete analysis.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(knitr)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
set.seed(11111)

UrlTrain <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
UrlTest  <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

training <- read.csv(url(UrlTrain))
testing  <- read.csv(url(UrlTest))
```

### Data Preprocessing
```{r}
inTrain  <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
TrainSet <- training[inTrain, ]
TestSet  <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(TrainSet)
dim(TestSet)
```

Both created datasets have 160 variables. Those variables have plenty of NA, that can be removed with the cleaning procedures below. The Near Zero variance (NZV) variables are also removed and the ID variables as well.

```{r}
NZV <- nearZeroVar(TrainSet)
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, -NZV]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, -NZV]
dim(TrainSet)
dim(TestSet)

# remove variables that are mostly NA
AllNA    <- sapply(TrainSet, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, AllNA==FALSE]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, AllNA==FALSE]
dim(TrainSet)
dim(TestSet)

# remove identification only variables (columns 1 to 5)
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, -(1:5)]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, -(1:5)]
dim(TrainSet)
dim(TestSet)
```

Therefore, after the preprocessing step, we are left with only 54 variables.

### Correlation Analysis
```{r}
corMatrix <- cor(TrainSet[, -54])
corrplot(corMatrix, order = "FPC", method = "color", type = "lower", 
         tl.cex = 0.6, tl.col = 'black')
```

Positive correlations are displayed in blue and negative correlations in red color. Since, there is insignificant correlation (less large intensity color blocks) among the variables, we don't need to perform principal component analysis on our dataset.

### Prediction Model
We will build three models for the training data and accuracy will be evaluated using confusion matrix. The model with the higest accuracy will be selected for predicting the classes of test data.

#### Decision Trees
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules. Decision tree learning uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). _Source:_ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)

```{r}
modFitDecTree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=TrainSet, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitDecTree)

# prediction on Test dataset
predictDecTree <- predict(modFitDecTree, newdata=TestSet, type="class")
confMatDecTree <- confusionMatrix(predictDecTree, TestSet$classe)
confMatDecTree
```

#### Random Forest
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. _Source:_ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)

```{r}
controlRF <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=FALSE)
modFitRandForest <- train(classe ~ ., data=TrainSet, method="rf",
                          trControl=controlRF)
modFitRandForest$finalModel

# prediction on Test dataset
predictRandForest <- predict(modFitRandForest, newdata=TestSet)
confMatRandForest <- confusionMatrix(predictRandForest, TestSet$classe)
confMatRandForest
```

### Applying the Selected Model to the Test Data
The accuracy of the 2 regression modeling methods above are:

1. Decision Tree : 0.7325
2. Random Forest : 0.998

Therefore,we select the Random Forest model to predict the 20 quiz results (testing dataset) as shown below.

```{r}
predictTEST <- predict(modFitRandForest, newdata=testing)
predictTEST
```
